## Introduction

In the [Binding of Isaac: Repentance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426300/The_Binding_of_Isaac_Repentance/), there are a ton of co-op babies. Even though most of the babies are only cosmetic and do not have special abilities, a tremendous amount of work has gone into designing them, coding them, and creating all of the sprites. This is an area of the game that is unknown and unused by 99% of the Isaac player-base. It's time for that to change.

This mod adds a new character called "Random Baby". When playing this character, on every floor, you will be assigned a random baby from [this list](./docs/babies.md). Each baby has a unique item or ability. Some babies are very strong, while others are very weak. But they only last for a single floor. Due to the random nature of the babies, this mod should provide fresh experiences time and time again.

A lot of the babies will make you quite powerful, which can remove the difficulty of a normal Isaac run. Instead, challenge yourself to beat the game as fast as possible! (This mod was deliberately designed for speedrunning and racing other people.)

## Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) Integration

If you use the [Rebirth Item Tracker](https://github.com/Rchardon/RebirthItemTracker), the baby name and description will be written to the "mod_text.txt" file, which is located next to "Rebirth Item Tracker.exe". You can use Open Broadcaster Software (OBS) to capture this text file in order to easily show the current baby to your live stream on Twitch/YouTube.

## Other Notes

- In the vanilla game, there are 71 babies that grant special abilities (28 from Rebirth, 28 babies from Afterbirth, 4 from Afterbirth+, and 11 from Repentance). Of these, every single one was redesigned to be more interesting (except for Psy Baby & Sucky Baby).
- New abilities were created from scratch for all of the other cosmetic co-op babies.
- Additionally, the 27 shooting familiars were added as playable babies, with new custom abilities for each.
