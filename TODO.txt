TODO:

- refactor global variables
- SaveDataManager
- auto generate documentation from parsing babies.ts

Babies to change:
- Puncher Baby : It appear that the difference isn't very noticeable between 1 and 10 Punching Bags. 1 Punching Bag + 1 Lost Fly would make enemies more unpredictable

- Snail Baby - 0.5x speed
- O Baby - Starts with Tiny Planet

Potential new effects:
- spawn Lil Portal portal after picking up 8 pickups
- Glitched pickups (all pickups rotate between 5 pickups like Glitched Crown on items)
- Exploding a tinted rock teleports you to a random special room (item room, shop, planetarium, devil deal, angel room, error room, black market, secret room, super secret room, ultra secret room, mini-boss room, boss room, arcade, challenge, curse, sacrifice, library, Vault, Dice room, bedrooms) (Prevent this effect from appearing in Chest and Dark Room)
- Enemies turn into giant poops when touched (improved E. Coli)
- Every sound effect is randomized
- Starts with 3 Knife piece 1 + 3 Knife Piece 2
- Spawn every type of machine in the starting room
- Spawns a golden troll bomb in every room
- Starts with Cursed Penny
- Glowing Hourglass effect on 2nd hit (per room)
