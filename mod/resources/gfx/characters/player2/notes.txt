- Some images are not 32x256, which will cause graphical glitches with the "001.000_player_co-op.anm2" file, so they have been explicitly resized to 32x256 here.
- The "220_baby_plug.png" file was edited to remove a graphical bug on the 3rd frame.
- The "574_baby_foodreviewer.png" file was edited to swap the left and right frames.
